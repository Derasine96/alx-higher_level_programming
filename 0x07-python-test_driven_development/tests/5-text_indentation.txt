The ``text_indentation`` module
===========================

This module provides the ``text_indentation`` function for printing
a text with 2 new lines after selected characters.
Selected characters(. ? :)

Using ``text_indentation(text)`` 
------------------------
  
First import ``text_indentation()``:

    >>> text_indentation = __import__('5-text_indentation').text_indentation
    
Then use it:

    
Print a short sentence with .

    >>> text_indentation("Hello, World. My name is Chidex") # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    Hello, World.
    <BLANKLINE>
    My name is Chidex
    <BLANKLINE>
   
Print a long sentence with .


    >>> text_indentation("This is a very long sentence. It has been written by me to test this program."
    ...                  "It contains many words and sentences so it can be used as an example of how to use this program.")  # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    This is a very long sentence.
    <BLANKLINE>
    It has been written by me to test this program.
    <BLANKLINE>
    It contains many words and sentences so it can be used as an example of how to use this program.
    <BLANKLINE>

    >>> text_indentation("Hello, Do I know you? You look so familiar. My name is Chidex")  # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    Hello, Do I know you?
    <BLANKLINE>
    You look so familiar.
    <BLANKLINE>
    My name is Chidex
    <BLANKLINE>

    >>> text_indentation("Hello, Do I know you? You look so familiar: My name is Chidex")  # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    Hello, Do I know you?
    <BLANKLINE>
    You look so familiar:

    <BLANKLINE>
